College Management System created by Michael Wayteck

The goal of this project was to create an application that displays data pertaining to a college enrollment system.
The main reason for creating this was to further develop my understanding on SQL and java interactions. The application
allows for Staff member to edit and update nearly all of the tables within the database and see the results of their 
actions in real-time. It also allows faculty to search for any Student, Faculty, or Staff based on their ID number. The
Student menu allows for enrollment of students and allows a student to search for multiple different things. However, the
Student section is not fully developed and will be a task of mine to complete in the coming months. This application uses 
a GUI using swing elements. I used an outline of a GUI I found online using Netbeans and I added the functionality to fufil 
the requirementsof the project. The data is displayed using JDBC and SQL statements. There are certain things that made this 
project difficult,with the main one being how to set up the whole project. This is the first time I have been given this much 
freedom on a project and I found it very difficult to figure out how i wanted the whole thing to be displayed to the user. It 
is much easier to display everything to the user but when they want specific data, it becomes harder to think about it the
eye of the user. To help with thisI decided to make a HUB menu that can direct you to multiple different things from
a single page.
